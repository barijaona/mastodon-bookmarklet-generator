# mastodon-bookmarklet-generator
A webpage that eases installation of bookmarklets that make it easier to follow people on Mastodon and interact with conversations.

A common error for people migrating from mainstream social media platforms to Mastodon is believing that dedicated applications are effective tools for discovering new content.

This is an error, because dedicated clients are designed to deliver content passing through your instance. Which is only a subset of all available content, especially if the instance you are registered to is relatively recent and small.

Because of the decentralized structure of the Fediverse, a web browser is much more efficient than a dedicated Mastodon client to make interesting discoveries. Indeed, you will see much more content if you use your web browser to follow web links and discover the entirety of conversations on the instances where other authors are registered.

But you will quickly feel that reacting to a post or following someone who is not in your instance is a bit tedious. This tool is designed to generate bookmarks that make things easier.

Three bookmarks are generated :

- __Follow__ : bring back to your instance the user profile you are currently seeing, so that you can follow this user;
- __React__ : bring back to your instance the post you are currently reading, so that you can boost (re-post) or like this post;
- __Publish__ : prepare a new post with the title and the URL of any webpage you are currently reading.
